# XR21B1411 driver for Orange Pi Zero with forced RS-485 mode

This driver is based on the original driver from [Exar](https://www.exar.com/content/document.ashx?id=21652) (version 1A for Linux 2.6.18 to 3.4.x). Two amendments were made to the original version:
* Compilation errors were fixed
* RS-485 mode was forced

The driver was tested with [Armbian 5.25](https://dl.armbian.com/orangepizero/archive/).

To build and install the driver follow [README.txt](README.txt).
